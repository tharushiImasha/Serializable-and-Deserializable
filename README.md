# Serialization and Deserialization in Java

This repository contains a simple example demonstrating the serialization and deserialization process in Java.

## Overview

Serialization converts an object's state into a byte stream, while deserialization reconstructs the object from the byte stream. These processes are essential for object persistence, communication, and more.
